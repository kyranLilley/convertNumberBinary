# convertNumberBinary

Today was quite a struggle for me as you know.
I ended up finding some good examples , realising that my mistake is that i learned how to read binary code once upon a time and confused that with calculating binary numbers.

That got me thinking and searching and i found a few examples and had to actually spend a few hours trying to understand how certian things worked.One of the best feelings is readign code that makes absolutley no sense to me and deciphering it and coming to an end result that is clean and tidy and that i am happy to send.

Sorry for the grammar i have to rush this and get onto a another assinment. 
But i have testid this and am confident it should work to a good standard.
Very challanging for me and glad to see it finished.
